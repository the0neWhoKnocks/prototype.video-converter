## Video Converter

A simple interface that allows for converting a video into the standard video
formats required for cross-platform compatibility with HTML5 video.

---

## Features

* Drag & Drop or standard file input which allows uploading of files.
* During the conversion process, if something goes wrong, or you simply want
to just close your browser and come back at a later time; the tool is smart
enough to know a job is still running and allows you to view the progress
of that job.
* Convert multiple files in the same batch.
* Can grab a video thumbnail after videos have been converted.
* Once the video has been converted and a thumbnail has been chosen, you
can then preview the video along with all it's converted sources.
